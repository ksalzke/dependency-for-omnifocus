# About

This is an Omni Automation plug-in bundle for OmniFocus that allows for the creation of task dependencies.

_Please note that all scripts on my GitHub account (or shared elsewhere) are works in progress. If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions please let me know--and do please make sure you backup your database before running scripts from an amateur on the internet!)_

## Known issues 

Refer to ['issues'](https://github.com/ksalzke/dependency-omnifocus-plugin/issues) for known issues and planned changes/enhancements.

Changes to the way data from this plugin is stored were made in version 3. If you were using a previous version, you can use the script `updateToV3.omnifocusjs` (saved in this repository) to move to the new structure. Simply move this file into your plugins folder; once it has been run once, it may be deleted.

# Installation & Set-Up

**Important note: for this plug-in bundle to work correctly, my [Synced Preferences for OmniFocus plugin](https://github.com/ksalzke/synced-preferences-for-omnifocus) is also required and needs to be added to the plug-in folder separately.**

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ksalzke/dependency-omnifocus-plugin/releases/latest).
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Move the `.omnifocusjs` file to your OmniFocus plug-in library folder (or open it to install).
4. Manually create the three tags below in OmniFocus. (These can be placed anywhere in your OmniFocus database.)
5. Configure your preferences using the `Preferences` action. (Note that to run this action, no tasks can be selected.)

The plugin makes use of three tags:

| Tag          | Example             | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Marker       | `Make Prerequisite` | A temporary tag used to denote which actions should become prerequisites when the `Add Prerequisite` action is run.     |
| Prerequisite | `ðŸ”‘`                 | Denotes a task that is required to be completed before another (dependant) task becomes available.                      |
| Dependant    | `ðŸ”’`                 | Denotes a task that is currently unavailable because it is waiting for another task to be completed. (Set to `On Hold`) |

These tags can be set by using the 'Preferences' action, or the user will be prompted to choose them when one is first required.

# Actions

This plug-in contains the following actions:

## Add Prerequisite Marker

This action can be run when one or more tasks are selected. It adds the temporary marker tag to the selected task(s) in preparation for the `Add Prerequisite` step.

## Add Prerequisite

This action can be run when one or more tasks have the marker tag and one or more tasks or projects are selected.

For each prerequisite/dependant pair, the `addDependency` function is run i.e. each selected task becomes a dependant of each tagged task.

## Remove Prerequisite(s)

This action is available when one or more tasks or projects with prerequisite actions are selected.

It prompts the user to select from a list of the tasks' prerequisite actions and removes the chosen prerequisite(s) from any selected tasks by using the `removeDependancy` function.

## Remove Dependant(s)

This action is available when one or more tasks or projects with dependent actions are selected.

It prompts the user to select from a list of the tasks' dependent actions and removes the chosen dependant(s) from any selected tasks by using the `removeDependancy` function.

## Go To Prerequisite

This action is available when a single task or project with one or more prerequisite actions is selected.

If there is only one prerequisite task, this action navigates to that task.

If there is more than one prerequisite task, the user is first prompted to select which one they would like to navigate to.

## Go To Dependant

This action is available when a single task or project with one or more dependant actions is selected.

If there is only one dependant task, this action navigates to that task.

If there is more than one dependant task, the user is first prompted to select which one they would like to navigate to.

## Check Prerequisites

This action can be run when no tasks or projects are selected.

It reviews all the dependencies and updates them as needed by running `updateDependencies`.

If the preference to "Set due dates when updating 'Check Prerequisites' action" has been selected, then `updateDueDates` is also run.

## Complete For Prerequisites

This action can be run when one or more tasks or projects are selected.

It marks the selected tasks or projects as complete and runs the `updateDependencies` function, to make any tasks that were waiting on selected tasks (or completed parent tasks) available.

## Update Due Dates

This action can be run when no tasks or projects are selected. It runs the `updateDueDates` function.

## Update Defer Dates

This action can be run when no tasks or projects are selected. It runs the `updateDeferDates` function.

## Preferences

This action allows the user to set the preferences for the plug-in. These sync between devices using the Synced Preferences plugin linked above.

There is a preference to select each of the tags outlined above. In addition, the following preferences are available:

* **Set due dates when updating 'Check Prerequisites' action**. If this is selected, then `updateDueDates` is also run as part of the 'Check Prerequisites' action.
* **Set defer dates when updating 'Check Prerequisites' action**. If this is selected, then `updateDeferDates` is also run as part of the 'Check Prerequisites' action.
* **Add link to related tasks to notes**. If this is selected, a link to the prerequisite task is added to the note of the dependant task when a new link is created, and vice versa. (Note that this setting does not change the notes for existing dependencies.)

# Functions

This plugin contains the following functions within the `dependencyLibrary` library:

## `loadSyncedPrefs () : SyncedPref`

Returns the [SyncedPref](https://github.com/ksalzke/synced-preferences-for-omnifocus) object for this plugin.

If the user does not have the plugin installed correctly, they are alerted.

## `getLinks () : Array<Array[string]>`

Returns an array containing a list of dependancy pairs, as stored in the SyncedPref object for this plugin.

Each pair is stored as a two-element array: the first is the ID of the prerequisite task and the second is the ID of the dependant task.

e.g. a sample return value might be `[["joAuGBEjN5C","gPTdVFqONl9"],["odwDCDRUWng","joAuGBEjN5C"],["oYQo_hRwCER","joAuGBEjN5C"],["dECOjinH-_3","joAuGBEjN5C"],["ptHMBTN7FMz","hhepNkpRFwh"]]`

If no links have been created yet, an empty array is returned.

## `addDependency (prereq: Task, dep: Task) : Promise`

This asynchronous function:
1. Adds the dependant tag to the dependant task and the prerequisite tag to the prerequisite task
2. Prepends a link to the prerequisite tasks in the dependant task's note in the form `[ DEPENDANT: omnifocus:///task/<id> ] Task name`, and prepends a similar link to the dependant task's note. (This is not done if the option is deselected in preferences.)
3. Saves a "link" in the SyncedPref object (see `getLinks` for details on how these are stored)
4. If the dependant task has children, then the function is called again for either all children (in the case of a parallel action group) or the first child (in the case of a sequential action group).
5. Removes the marker tag from the prerequisite

## `removeDependency (prereqID: string, depID: string) : Promise`

This asynchronous function takes the ID of two tasks as input, and:
1. Removes the "link" from the SyncedPref object (see `getLinks` for details on how these are stored)
2. If the prerequisite task still exists:
   * Removes the link to the dependant task from its note
   * If there are no remaining dependancies, removes the prerequisite tag from the prerequisite task
3. If the dependant task still exists:
    * Removes the link to the prerequisite task from its note
    * If there are no remaining prerequisites, removes the dependant tag from the dependant task
    * Runs `removeDependant` on all children (in the case of a parallel action group) or the first child (in the case of a sequential action group).


## `getPrefTag(prefTag: string) : Promise<Tag>`

This asynchronous function takes the name of a preference tag (`markerTag`, `prerequisiteTag` or `dependantTag`) as input and, if the tag ID is set in preferences, returns the tag. If no preference has been set, the `Preferences` action is run and then the function is called again.

## `getDependants (task: Task) : Array<Task>`

This function takes a task object as input, and returns an array of its (direct) dependent tasks. If it has no dependent tasks, it returns an empty array.

## `getPrereqs (task: Task) : Array<Task>`

This function takes a task object as input, and returns an array of its (direct) prerequisite tasks. If it has no prerequisite tasks, it returns an empty array.

## `getAllPrereqs (task: Task) : Array<Task>`

This function takes a task object as input, and returns an array of its prerequisites, both direct and indirect. i.e. if T1 is a prerequisite of T2 and T2 is a prerequisite of T3, then passing T3 as a parameter would return an array containing both T1 and T2.

## `getAllDependants (task: Task) : Array<Task>`

This function takes a task object as input, and returns an array of its dependants, both direct and indirect. i.e. if T1 is a prerequisite of T2 and T2 is a prerequisite of T3, then passing T1 as a parameter would return an array containing both T2 and T3.

## `updateDependencies ()`

This function goes through the links stored in the SyncedPref object, and for any link where one or both of the values has been completed, dropped, or no longer exists, runs the `removeDependency` function.

## `updateDueDates ()`

For each dependant task, this function finds all prerequisites (direct and indirect) using the `getAllPrerequisites` function. For each prerequisite, it then updates the due date if there is no effective due date set, or if the currently set due date is _after_ the dependant's due date. It also updates any sequential actions that precede the prerequisite task.

## `updateDeferDates ()`

For each prerequisite task, this function finds all dependants (direct and indirect) using the `getAllDependants` function. For each dependant, it then updates the defer date if there is no effective defer date set, or if the currently set defer date is _before_ the prerequisite's defer date. It also updates any sequential actions that follow the dependant task.
