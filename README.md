# About

This is an Omni Automation plug-in bundle for OmniFocus that allows for the creation of task dependencies. (Further details provided below.)

_Please note that all scripts on my GitHub account (or shared elsewhere) are works in progress. If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions please let me know--and do please make sure you backup your database before running scripts from an amateur on the internet!)_

# Installation & Set-Up

**Important note: for this plug-in bundle to work correctly, my [Function Library for OmniFocus](https://github.com/ksalzke/function-library-for-omnifocus) is also required and needs to be added to the plug-in folder separately.**

1. Click on the green `Clone or download` button above to download a `.zip` file of all the files in this GitHub repository.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Open the configuration file located at `Resources/dependencyConfig.js` and make any changes needed to reflect your OmniFocus set-up. Further explanations of the options are included within that file as comments.
4. Rename the entire folder to anything you like, with the extension `.omnifocusjs`
5. Move the resulting file to your OmniFocus plug-in library folder.

The plugin makes use of three tags:

| Tag          | Example             | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Marker       | `Make Prerequisite` | A temporary tag used to denote which actions should become prerequisites when the `Add Prerequisite` action is run.     |
| Prerequisite | `ðŸ”‘`                 | Denotes a task that is required to be completed before another (dependant) task becomes available.                      |
| Dependant    | `ðŸ”’`                 | Denotes a task that is currently unavailable because it is waiting for another task to be completed. (Set to `On Hold`) |

# Actions

This plug-in contains the following actions:

## Make Prerequisite

This action can be run when one or more tasks are selected. It is simply a helper function that adds the temporary marker tag to the prerequisite task in preparation for the `Add Prerequisite` step.

## Add Prerequisite

This action can be run when one or more tasks have the marker tag and a single task or project is selected. It:

1. For the selected (dependant) task/project:
    * Adds the dependant tag
    * Prepends link(s) to the prerequisite tasks in its note in the form `[ PREREQUISITE: omnifocus:///task/<id> ]`
    * If the selection is a project, changes its status to `On Hold`
2. For the prerequisite task (previously tagged with the marker tag):
    * Adds the prerequisite tag
    * Prepends link(s) to the dependant tasks in its note in the form `[ DEPENDANT: omnifocus:///task/<id> ]`
    * Removes the temporary marker tag

## Complete For Prerequisite

This action can be run when a single task or project is selected.

It marks the task as complete and runs the `checkDependantsForTaskAndAncestors` function (see below) to make any tasks that were waiting on the selected task (or its completed parent tasks) available.

## Check Prerequisites

This action can be run when no tasks or projects are selected.

It gets all remaining dependant tasks. For each one, it checks all of the task's prerequisites using the `checkDependants` function (see below); if all prerequisites have been completed this function makes the dependant task available.

# Functions

This plugin contains the following functions within the `dependencyLibrary` library:

## checkDependants

This function takes a prerequisite task object as input. If the task object has been completed, it gets a list of the task's dependant tasks and removes the prerequisite tag and note from those tasks.

It then checks the dependant tasks and, if there are no remaining prerequisites for these tasks, it removes the dependant tag (and, if it is a project, sets it to active).

## checkDependantsForTaskAndAncestors

This function takes a task object as input. It checks all ancestors of that task using the `checkDependants` function.
